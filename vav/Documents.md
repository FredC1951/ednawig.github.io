# Documents
## Introduction

The documents presented here come from the personal archives of Ter-Vaganian's widow, Klavdiia Generalova, and from
official state archives of the former Soviet Union. Whenever possible, we give a scanned image of the document, a
translation of its contents, and comments on the significance of the information provided. Most of the documents were
collected during the period of 1991-1995, when access to material in archives in Russia was at times difficult or
non-existent. As in other sections of this website, we welcome any additional material that readers may provide.
