# Documents
## Introduction

The documents presented here come from the personal archives of the Voronsky family and from
official state archives of the former Soviet Union. Whenever possible, we give a scanned image
of the document, a translation of its contents, and comments on the significance of the
information provided. Most of the documents were collected during the period of 1991-1995,
when access to material in archives in Russia was at times difficult or non-existent.
As in other sections of this web site, we welcome any additional material that readers may provide.

            confirming the decision of the October Regional Committee to expel Voronsky from
            the Party on 15 March 1935. It is noted that Voronsky gave an explanation on
            16 November 1935. He was accused of giving support to the exiled writer, Mirov,
            in 1931, of not reporting this aid to the Party, and of maintaining ties with
            Sergei Zorin, a supporter of Trotsky and Zinoviev arrested by the NKVD.
