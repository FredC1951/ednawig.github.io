**Translation**: A few days ago, the OGPU arrested an illegal Trotskyist organization for
anti-Soviet activity. 150 people were arrested, including: Mdivani, Pankratov, Globus, Drobnis,
Kavtaradze, Voronsky, Gaevsky, Grinshtein and others. During a search, anti-Soviet illegal
literature was confiscated. The arrested people, as elements hostile to the proletarian
dictatorship, are subject to strict isolation.

**Comment**: L. D. Trotsky recorded brief remarks about this article as he was being deported
to exile in Turkey. He noted: "... we learned of new arrests -- of several hundred people,
including a hundred and fifty members of a so-called 'Trotskyist center.' Among the published
names were those of Kavtaradze, former chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of
Georgia; Mdivani, the former trade representative in Paris; Voronsky, the party's best
literary critic; and Drobnis, one of the most heroic figures of the Ukrainian revolution.
All of them were central figures in the party, men who helped organize the October Revolution."
