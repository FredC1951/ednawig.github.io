**Translation**: I request permission to travel to Moscow, since I need to consult with
Moscow physicians, and perhaps to receive clinical treatment under their supervision.
I became ill in March of this year. Local medical treatment did not help me.
Moreover, the conclusions of the physicians here about the character of my illness differ.

-- A. Voronsky. 7/IX/29. Pervomaiskaia, 60, Lipetsk.
