## HEARD:

VORONSKII Aleksandr Konstantinovich, born 1884, member of the VKP(b) since 1904, writer,

where he spent eight months. In 1930, restored to Party membership.

On 15 March 1935, expelled from the ranks of the VKP(b) by the October Regional Committee for
giving material support at the beginning of 1931 to the exiled writer Mirov, for not informing
the Party organs about this support, and for ties with Sergei Zorin, a supporter of Trotsky
and Zinoviev who has been arrested by the NKVD.

The resolution is confirmed by the Party Control of the Moscow area.

**Comment**:
<div style="text-align: left">
It is noted that Voronsky was shown the document, which is confirmed by his 
ignature. In August 1936, preparation for the first major frame-up trial was well underway.
It is not inconceivable that Voronsky was being considered as a defendant; Ter-Vaganian,
for instance, was added at the last minute. Voronsky would be arrested on February 1, 1937.
