## Postcard from Voronsky, in Exile in the Village of Kem', to his Mother, 16 February 1913

**Description**: First of two postcards from Voronsky, who was in exile in Kem',
to his mother on February 16, 1913, noting that he had no reliable news about the Tsar's
amnesty (to celebrate 300 years of the Romanov dynasty), but that he didn't expect full
clemency, just a possible shortening of his sentence. [Full text](../Texts/AKV_FGV130216.pdf) of the two postcards.
