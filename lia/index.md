# Liubov Isaakovna Akselrod (Ortodoks)
## (1868-1946)

![](Images/akselrod.jpg) 

Welcome to the L. I. Akselrod website. Our goal is to illustrate the life of 
this remarkable Marxist scholar and literary critic. As a devoted disciple of 
G. V. Plekhanov, Liubov Akselrod participated in many of the philosophical 
debates of the 1920s and 1930s. Yet her heritage remains largely unknown and 
unstudied.

New material is being added to the web site as it becomes available. 
Corrections, contributions and suggestions are welcome.
